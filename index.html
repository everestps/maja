            <p>This website was developed in the Computer Science Expedition class at Everest Public High School. It is located on the second floor in room 206. The school itself is in between fifth avenue and fourth, but you may only enter and exit one way. Fifth is the enterance and fourth is the exit. I am a first-time student of this class, Maja, and this is my very first website I have ever made.</p>
            <p>I am taking this class because of a few reasons. Let me make a list of them, just for you:</p>
            <ul>
                <li class="purple" style="text-align:center">Coding is freaking <em><strong>awesome!</strong></em></li>
                <li class="green" style="text-align:center">I've been interested in computer science for quite some time now.</li>
              <li class="blue" style="text-align:center">I was drawn by the prospect of <em><strong>robots!</strong></em></li>
              <li class="red" style="text-align:center">I've always wanted to learn how to code, but never really got around to it.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>In this class, we are learning about coding, including how to code and what the elements of coding are. We will have made a website, (this one,) a video game, an AI, and by the time we have finished this class.
            <p>On my webpage, you can find some description of HTML and CSS, a page about me, and information on Computer Hardware. And all of this was created with code from scratch. I can't really believe that I made all of it myself, you know? But anyways,</p>
            <h3>I hope you enjoy your visit!</h3>
          <h4>Thank you for coming</h4>
